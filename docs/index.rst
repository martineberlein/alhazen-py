This repository contains a complete python implementation of the debugging tool **Alhazen**,
initially proposed by Kampmann et al. [[KHZ2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3368089.3409687)].
With this reimplementation we not only provide a concise and fast version of **Alhazen**,
we also include more machine learning models to explain the circumstances of failing programs.
